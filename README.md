# Clinical Data Analysis: SDTM to ADaM Transformation
This repository features SAS code for converting Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) data into Analysis Data Model (ADaM) datasets, including domains for Adverse Events (ADAE), Exposure (ADEX), Time-to-Event (ADTTE), and Subject-Level Analysis (ADSL). Each transformation adheres to CDISC standards, enabling consistent, high-quality clinical data analysis.


## Overview
This project contains SAS programs and workflows to transform clinical trial data from the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) format to the Analysis Data Model (ADaM) format, aligning with CDISC standards. The transformation supports clinical data analysis for regulatory submission and reporting.

The repository includes transformations for the following ADaM domains:
- **ADAE**: Adverse Events Analysis
- **ADEX**: Exposure Analysis
- **ADTTE**: Time-to-Event Analysis
- **ADSL**: Subject-Level Analysis

## Project Details

**ADAE (Adverse Events Analysis):** Aggregates adverse event data, aligning with ADaM standards to support safety analysis.

**ADEX (Exposure Analysis):** Prepares dosing and exposure data to allow for comprehensive treatment assessments.

**ADTTE (Time-to-Event Analysis):** Converts survival or event-time data, structured for time-to-event analysis in clinical trials.

**ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis):** Produces subject-level data containing demographic and baseline information required for study analysis.
